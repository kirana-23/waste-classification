With the rise of development of smart cities across India, a Smart Garbage Management system is very necessary. Since the amount of waste is multiplying day by day. The purpose of this research is to notify the levelness of the garbage bin and to build a real time application which recognizes the type of waste and categorize it into defined categories. The model used for this study is Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a Machine Learning algorithm which is used on a dataset containing images of garbage. This study aims to address the pressing issue of inefficient waste management by employing cutting-edge technology for effective garbage classification and monitoring. The system integrates various sensors, IoT devices, and machine learning algorithms to automate the process of sorting and tracking waste, thereby promoting sustainable practices and environmental conservation. Key features of this study include real-time monitoring of garbage bins to assess fill levels, classification of waste into recyclable, organic, and non-recyclable categories using image recognition techniques, and data analytics for optimizing waste collection routes and schedules. Through a user-friendly interface accessible via mobile and web platforms, stakeholders can visualize data insights, receive notifications for bin maintenance, and contribute to community engagement initiatives. By implementing this idea, municipalities and waste management authorities can enhance operational efficiency, reduce landfill overflow, and encourage citizen participation in waste reduction efforts. This project represents a significant step towards building smarter, cleaner, and more sustainable cities for the benefit of present and future generations.
